ShopSmart E-commerce Analytics + GA4 + Ads (ML & BI)

This end-to-end data science and business intelligence project focuses on solving key e-commerce challenges such as poor marketing ROI, rising customer churn, and limited visibility into regional sales performance.
The project is built for ShopSmart, a multi-country African e-commerce platform operating in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Egypt. It demonstrates how data-driven insights can directly improve decision-making and profitability across multiple markets.

# Project Objective

To integrate analytics from GA4, ads data, and e-commerce transactions to understand customer behavior, forecast lifetime value, detect anomalies, and optimize marketing investments.
This project unifies raw data into actionable insights through Python, SQL, and Tableau workflows.

# Key Problems Solved

Identify and reduce customer churn through predictive modeling

Forecast Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for better marketing segmentation

Optimize ad spending and measure cross-channel ROI

Detect fraudulent or bot-driven activity in orders

Improve sales forecasting and regional performance tracking

# Machine Learning (Python – Google Colab)

Churn Prediction (Random Forest) – ROC AUC: 0.88

CLV Forecasting (Gradient Boosting) – MAE: $42

Product Recommendation System (SVD) – Personalized Top-3 products

Ad ROI Optimization (Random Forest) – TikTok ROAS: 4.2x

Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest) – Flags suspicious orders

Each model includes feature engineering, model evaluation, and business interpretation.
